# Cat vs Dogs Classification using CNN

This project is a learning-focused deep learning application that classifies images of cats and dogs using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

The goal of this project is to understand CNN fundamentals such as convolution, pooling, and image-based classification using TensorFlow and Keras.
